        <h2> Phase 0: Requirements and Specifications </h2>
        <p id="p1">
            The objective of this assignment is to create a weather app that has 3 API calls. The three calls are first
            to get the location of the computer
            through their IP address using a geolocator. Once the latitude and longitude is obtained, that information
            is used to get the current weather for
            that specific location with the second API call. Thirdly, with the coordinates again, the same site is
            queried to obtain a 5-day, 3 hour forecast
            which is then displayed on the page each one. The user then can vote which ones are likely and which ones
            are unlikely. This is pretty much all
            done with Vue and not Vanilla javascript.
        </p>

        <h2> Phase 1: System Analysis </h2>
        <h4>Data Used by the Program:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>input from user : The user's IP address is obtained. The user can also click on different forecasts to
                vote on their likeliness.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Form the Output will Take:</h4>
        <p>The output will be a SPA built with Vue, with different sections for the top links, title, location, current
            weather, and predictions. It is interactable
            because the user can click and vote on the bottom forecasts.
        </p>
        <h4>Algorithms and Formula to be Used:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><code>Vue</code> Vue is used in the html instead of the lower-level template language (Django). Vue is
                also used in the javascript to create
                apps to mount to html elements to monitor their changes in the DOM. The data block contains the
                characteristics of the app.</li>
            <li><code>fetch</code>: There are 3 fetch calls. The second call is nested in the first call. All must be
                wrapped in a single try/catch block
                because the errors are pushed to the bottom anyway. They use promise chaining to avoid hadouken code.
            </li>
            <li><code>methods</code>I'll probably need a method to deal with the dates and a method to toggle the color
                of the divs.</li>
            <li><code>computed properties</code>I'm going to use computed properties to monitor the number of likely,
                unlikely, and neutral votes in the page. I'm
                doing this because if one isn't changing but is being called multiple times, I want that information to
                be cached so it's not being recalculated.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h2> Phase 2: Implementation </h2>
        <h4>index.html</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><code>navBar</code>Top navigation bar with links to the plan and back</li>
            <li>Titleblock: pretty self explanatory</li>
            <li>Location: made by making an API call</li>
            <li>Current Conditions: made an API call and printing out the results</li>
            <li>5-day 3 hour forecast: 40 div's showing a prediction for every 3 hours for 5 days after the current
                time.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>script.js</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><code>Vue.createApp</code> This is where the data() block is stored with it's return vals.</li>
            <li><code>methods</code>Date converter method, toggling the color of div method</li>
            <li><code>computed</code>This section is for computed properties. This has three for-loops that go through
                and count the number of likely,
                unlikely, and neutral divs to be constantly monitored by Vue.</li>
            <li><code>created</code>The created() is a block in the rendering of the page that can be targeted with Vue.
                This is where the fetch()
                calls are made.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>I couldn't figure out why I was getting a CORS error for about 30 minutes. Turns out, for some reason, when I
            copied over the URL from one of the API's doc pages, it didn't copy the "https://" in the very beginning. It 
            only started with the hostname so the site was freaking out. That was a pain. I also tried figuring out how to 
            modify classes of a div with Vue but couldn't figure that out so had to switch how I was figuring out the 
            counts. The rest went suspiciously smooth.
        </p>

        <h2> Phase 3: Testing and Debugging</h2>
        <p>I used the javascript console a lot in debugging. That's really the only debugging method I used. I just made sure the json would print to the console, 
            looked at the values that I needed, and wrote the code with them side-by-side. I also used the network tab in the developer tools to make sure my code 
            handles well if the sites are blocked.
        </p>

        <h2> Phase 4: Deployment</h2>
        <p>
            Been constantly committing to Git-lab so we're good to go:).

    <div>
        <h2> Phase 5: Maintenence</h2>
        <p> What parts of the program are sloppily written and hard to understand?:<br> -----I don't think any parts of
            this program are written sloppily. I got this
            assignment done faster than usual so I've had a lot of time to look it over and double check things. <br>
            Are there parts of your program you don't understand
            how they work? <br> ----- I'm still a little confused with Vue but it's pretty self explanatory as you go. 
            <br> If a bug is reported in a few months, how long would it take you to find the cause? <br> -----I think I could find the cause
            pretty easily. I think it would take me only 5 minutes or less because this program isn't huge and I understand most of it.<br>
             Will your documentation make sense to anybody else/ youself in 6 months time? <br>----- Yes, I might need a quick refresher on Vue 
             but the program is small so I could pick it back up pretty quick. <br>How easy would it be to add a new feature to the program in 
             a year? <br> ----- It would be super easy, my documentation was really good. <br> Will your program work after upgrading...<br>
              ----- your computer's hardware? Depends on a lot of things. I don't really know enough to make a guess. <br> -----the
            operating system? Yes because It's still going to use html and javascript the same and http the same. We also were instructed to use 
            "data-" when binding new attributes so we good.<br>Javascript/Html? <br>----- All depends on what is actually changed.
